1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

One of the most fascinating topics covered this quarter is the application of eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analysis in understanding gene regulation. Specifically, exploring how variations in DNA sequences can influence gene expression has opened up new ways to link genetic variants with complex traits and diseases. This approach allows for a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying diseases by connecting regulatory regions to gene expression, which could lead to better therapeutic targets.


1. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For the Quarter 2 Project, I’d be interested in investigating the combined effect of eQTLs and polygenic risk scores (PRS) on disease susceptibility. This project could involve identifying significant eQTLs related to a disease trait and integrating these with PRS to improve predictive accuracy. By combining eQTLs, which provide insights into gene expression levels, with PRS, which assess cumulative genetic risk, the investigation could reveal new associations and provide a more comprehensive risk model.



1. **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make is to incorporate more advanced statistical methods, like Bayesian inference, to account for uncertainties in the data more effectively. This approach would provide a probabilistic framework to estimate the effect sizes of genetic variants, which could improve the robustness and interpretability of the results. Additionally, I would consider incorporating more stringent quality control steps to ensure data consistency and reduce noise.


1. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in exploring machine learning techniques, such as random forests or support vector machines, to enhance the predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores. Additionally, incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques, like principal component analysis (PCA), could help manage high-dimensional genomic data, making the analysis more efficient and potentially revealing hidden patterns in the data.
